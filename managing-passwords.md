# Managing Passwords

Please check the email addresses you use (your private email accounts) with https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see if your email and it's password has been compromised.
If you have been using the email and it's password for some time there is an unfortunately high chance the password has been compromised.

IF your email is compromised, you need to fix that by:
1. Resetting your passwords (unless you already have since the breach date). Any account where you used the same password is potentially compromised.
1. Stop using the same 3 passwords for everything
   - How.. Sticky notes? Add a number on the end? No :face_palm:! Time to use a password manager :sunglasses:...
1. Use a password manager to generate & remember all your passwords
   - What is a password manager? A password manager remembers passwords for you. It also generates them for you, so that each website has a strong unique password. You only have to remember your master password - to unlock your password manager.
   - Choose a good master password. Consider a phrase instead of a word. Don't use an old compromised password for this. Don't make it too hard to remember, as forgetting would be a disaster.
   - Us instructors use https://keepassxc.org/ and https://www.lastpass.com/, and other staff use https://www.dashlane.com/
   - All three options are plenty secure. KeepassXC is the most secure option, but is not hosted online (passwords saved to your disk encrypted with your master password)
   - Lastpass and Dashlane store passwords on their online server encrypted with your master password, so can be easily used between multiple computers.
