# Course delivery

## Overview

- Pre Course setup
- O Week

## Tools used

- Google Classroom: The course schedule is delivered using Google Classroom. This is where learners can understand what they will be working on prior to commencing their journey and what their first week at DI will entail.

# Class meeting guide

- Formal class meetings are not required for delivering this onboarding course, however the below example is still recommended to familiarise yourself with and it would be good to setup 1-2 introductory meetings for new cohorts in o-week. Recommendations for Tuesday morning Intro & google classroom tutorial and Friday morning debrief of week & segway to curriculum.
- Watch [how to use the class meeting guide](https://www.loom.com/share/ed630a1904d242dfb77dc7d18c2c83e8) for an example of how you might use this in google calendar to achieve this.

- As of mid 2021, attendance and the asking for help procedure is relatively new - building good learner habits off the bat will set them up well for later in the course.
- Encourage them to skim read the handbooks and bookmark them for later. They will need to have an understanding of the above bullet point though.
- Attempt to establish if any learners are using windows, as their initial setup may be a little more complicated.
