## Introduction

Use the following material as a guide to run the Pre-Course and O-Week delivery.

This runbook is a living document, and you can modify and adapt it as you refine the delivery of this course. Add or replace meeting examples as required.

---

## Course philosophy

- This course is a prerequisite to commencing any initial DI course and aims to establish setting up learner environments.

- We believe that this will help reduce technological blocks moving forward into the curriculum and establish consistancy in learning environments among learners.

---

## Terminology

- **DI:** Developers Institute.
- **Learners:** aka students. Our customers essentially.
- **TA:** Teaching assistant. To assist the Tech Lead & to assist the learners.
- **Tech Lead:** aka instructor or teacher. Responsible for organising & delivering this course to the learners.

---

# Before O-Week

A lot needs to happen before learners join us for their first day. Refer to the [Preparation for Orientation Week - Process](https://github.com/Developers-Institute-Internal/handbook-md/wiki/O-Week-Process) in the handbook to see tasks that need to be done. In particular, search for tasks that are assigned to `Tech Lead and TA`

---

# Course delivery

## Overview

- Pre Course setup
- O Week

## Tools used

- Google Classroom: The course schedule is delivered using Google Classroom. This is where learners can understand what they will be working on prior to commencing their journey and what their first week at DI will entail.

---

# Class meeting guide

- Formal class meetings are not required for delivering this onboarding course, however the below example is still recommended to familiarise yourself with and it would be good to setup 1-2 introductory meetings for new cohorts in o-week.
- Recommendations for Tuesday morning Intro & google classroom tutorial and Friday morning debrief of week & segway to curriculum.
- Also a good opportunity to introduce new cohort to other learners/staff, talent engine program, team building exercises. Example videos of some of these below.
- Watch [how to use the class meeting guide](https://www.loom.com/share/ed630a1904d242dfb77dc7d18c2c83e8) for an example of how you might use this in google calendar to achieve this.

### Day 1: Morning - Welcome event

You will be invited to this meeting by operations. It's an all company event where learners are introduced to Developers Institute. You may be expected to talk at this event, check with the meeting organiser.

---

### Day 1: Afternoon

Learners can work through Day 1 in Google Classrooms

---

### Day 2: Morning - Meet the previous cohort

#### Meeting Agenda

We are going to start this week by meeting the cohort ahead of you who completed Client Side last term

There will be opportunity for you to ask questions, and for them to answer questions, as well as introductions and sharing

#### Learning Objectives

- Let learners communicate as a group how they are feeling as they start the course
- Allow previous learners to share their experience to hopefully put them at ease

#### Tech Lead notes

As these groups are very large (around 60 people in the call), you can use a tool like [Slido](https://www.sli.do/) to facilitate the meeting with word clouds. An example of questions you could ask in Slido:

![slido example](img/slido-example.png)

General format of the meeting:

- Bring up the Slido, and give the new cohort 5 mins to capture what they are excited about. As words appear on the word clouds discuss the topics raised, with validation, or ask for clarification to get discussion happening. Timebox yourself to 10mins
- Do the same for the next question - what are you nervous about
- For the last slide, get the previous cohort to complete the last question (what advice would you give), and as you see words appearing talk to the points that are being raised, and if possible facilitate some discussion.

#### Duration

30mins

- Encourage them to skim read the handbooks and bookmark them for later. They will need to have an understanding of the above bullet point though.
- Attempt to establish if any learners are using windows, as their initial setup may be a little more complicated.

### Tech Lead/TA Notes:

- Accountability groups to be provided to the learners at random. based on a class size of 30, recommended to aim for 5 groups of 6 people. This will account for the possibility that some learners may drop out of the course, ie minimise the likelyness reshuffling groups in the future.
- Tech lead or TA to setup google meetings at 1.30pm to get learners in the habit of daily standups. Aim is to encourage communication and build team culture.
- Talent engine is a separate google classroom where learners build on tasks towards making themselves employable. This will be introduced to them as an optional highly recommended course to be aware of completing in their own time.

#### Accountability Groups meeting description

Add the following to the group meeting invitations

----

The intention of this group is to allow you to build relationships with your fellow students, to provide a space to ask and receive help, and a place to keep you accountable for getting through the material on time.

The expectation around your accountability group will be that this group is responsible for ensuring each of the members of the group is on track with working through the material. This can be done by helping each other to complete exercises, self-organised group tuition or pulling in instructors or TA’s for help if required.

In the software industry, it’s common to run a daily meeting called a “stand up”. It’s a daily coordination meeting where a team can identify how their work is flowing, and identify any blockers, and then co-ordinate to help fix the blockers. It’s named a stand up because generally, people will have to stand up in the meeting, this is to encourage keeping it a short meeting. 

Your accountability group will run this meeting themselves. Follow the agenda below:

**Agenda**
**Nominate a facilitator**

Self-select a person from the group who will be the meeting facilitator. It will be this person’s responsibility to follow the agenda and move the group along

**Attendance check**

The facilitator should check everyone from your group is present. If someone is missing, message them on Slack as a reminder. If you cannot get hold of a missing person, message your instructor and let them know

**Introductions** *10 mins*

Go around the room and introduce yourself. Where are you from? What are your motivations? 

**Standup** *10 mins*

The facilitator initiates a standup. This is a round-robin, where each person in the group answers the following questions:

- What part of the course are you currently working on?
- What do you intend to complete by the end of the day?
- Are you blocked (stuck) on anything, and need some help?

If someone is blocked, see if the group can help unblock that person. Otherwise ask for help from outside of the group, either in the cohort channel or from the teaching team

Once everyone has finished their standup, the meeting can be completed.
