# Class meeting guide

- Formal class meetings are not required for delivering this onboarding course, however the below example is still recommended to familiarise yourself with and it would be good to setup 1-2 introductory meetings for new cohorts in o-week. Recommendations for Tuesday morning Intro & google classroom tutorial and Friday morning debrief of week & segway to curriculum.

### Tech Lead/TA Notes:

- When giving learners an overview of the week remind them about the view more button for day 1. Video provided above.
- As of mid 2021, attendance and the asking for help procedure is relatively new - building good learner habits off the bat will set them up well for later in the course.
- Encourage them to skim read the handbooks and bookmark them for later. They will need to have an understanding of the above bullet point though.
- Attempt to establish if any learners are using windows, as their initial setup may be a little more complicated.
