# Preparing before orientation week

If you are wanting to prepare for the course before orientation week, you can pre-read the introductions to the core topics and tools, and possibly set-up your home computer with the tools and have a play.

Go through the information and links in the pre-course setup that we typically run though in orientation week.

Especially check out the links in the `Get started on HTML` and `Get started on CSS` sections, after reading about an overview of web development at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn. The w3school resources are great beginner sources.
