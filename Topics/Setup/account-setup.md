## Miro

Being a remote-first company, we need to be able to successfully communicate and collaborate together from anywhere. 

One tool we use for this is a digital 'whiteboard' called [Miro](https://miro.com/) (pronounced like “Hero”)
Miro makes it easy to brainstorm and collaborate all in real time. Everyone can create notes and designs, move things around, utelise post-its, draw and use all diffrent kinds of pre-built templates.

Some common uses of Miro at Developers Institute include:

- Designing Websites
- Collecting everyones ideas in one place
- Wireframing with your team
- Demonstating concepts in meetings
- Retros (A Retrospective), where we reflect as a team how we are working and learning

We suggest you sign up for a free account to gain access to any bonus features, but you can also join Miro collaborations as a guest.

## Frontend Masters

You will need a Frontend Masters account from week 2. However it's good to sign up and have a look around before then, as there are other courses that might interest you.

1. Go to [Getting Started with JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/), and click the red _Get Free Access Now_ button
2. Create an account, using your `@developersinstitute.co.nz` email address

**Note:** You can get a 6 month free subscription to Frontend Masters from the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). We will use free courses as part of the course, but with a premium subscription you have access to hundreds of high quality classes.

## Loom

We share a lot of videos in Loom. Create a Loom account so you can leave comments and feedback on videos that we share.
