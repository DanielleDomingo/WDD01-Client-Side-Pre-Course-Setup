# Preparing to Learn

Learning is hard work and requires dedicated self-discipline. It’s important to plan how you are going to manage your work/life balance, your time and your learning while here at the Developers Institute. 

## Work and Life Balance

Maintaining a healthy work and life balance will look different for each individual, but is important for your well-being to have healthy boundaries between studying and other commitments.

#### If working from home

- Have a conversation with the people in your life, make sure they understand that just because you're at home, it doesn't mean you're available.

- You may be working on this course remotely, but we maintain regular office hours at Developers Institute.

- Proactively planning your days to include a 'start of the day' and 'end of the day' routine is the key to ramping into and out of a workday successfully. A night and morning routine that has you refreshed and ready to begin your day at 9 am, followed by a 5 pm routine that has you leaving your home to walk the dog or going to the gym is a great way to create unmistakable separation.

It may take some time to get your routine working best for you, but think about what could make a good start and end activity for your daily routine.

Please reach out to staff if you need any support with this.

## Plan your days

Only you will know what kind of planning and daily practices will help you to achieve your goals while learning here. In the tech world, we use technology to solve problems and efficiently streamline tasks.

So check out the helpful tools below to get you started:

#### Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a great tool for task management. Create tasks and drag them between columns like ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’ & ‘Done’. You could use this to keep on top of your workload and help you focus on one thing at a time

#### Notion
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/personal) is like having a second brain. Capture all your notes in one place so you can easily refer back to them. Even if you don't use Notion, make sure you have some tool for capturing notes as you learn.

#### My Study Life
[My Study Life](https://www.mystudylife.com/) is helpful for managing your scheduling, tasks, timetables, and reminders across all platforms

#### Google Calendar

Block out time for working through certain learning material and completing tasks in your google calendar


#### Example use: 

      Use a Trello board with 4 columns: ‘Tasks’, ‘To Do by next meeting’, ‘Working on now’ & ‘Done’

      Block out 9 am to 9.20 in google calendar every day as ‘Get organised’: a time to check emails, meeting agenda requirements, and Slack comms.

      Use Notion to take notes and keep track of material to revisit if needed

      Set up google calendar notifications for just before meeting times so you won’t be late


Think about how you are going to manage your daily workload and make the most of your time

## Learning Tools

There are countless free tools and sites that can make learning easier. Don’t be afraid to utilise any of these if they are helpful for you to organise, learn or to build good habits.


- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) is a small application that lets you manage the windows on your screen. It allows you to arrange the windows to automatically take up full screen or half the screen etc.

- If you struggle to focus while reading there are many free screen readers and text-to-speech readers. Like: https://ttsreader.com/

- When watching videos some sites have speed controllers to watch content faster or slower as needed, but for everything else, you can install an extension to your browser to do that same thing. Like this one: [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)

- If easily distracted try blocking certain sites during study time with: https://selfcontrolapp.com/
