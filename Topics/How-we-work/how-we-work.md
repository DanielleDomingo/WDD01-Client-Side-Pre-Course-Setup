# How We Work At Developers Institute

## Communication

Communicating and collaborating with others will be at the forefront of your every day here at Developers Institute. We want to support you to build good communication habits and workplace skills, so it’s important to understand the expectation of communicating to a professional standard while you are here. 

The Diploma courses here are purposefully modeled to run like a workplace: 
- This means your instructors are your ‘Tech Leads’
- You the student, are a ‘Learner’
- Your Cohort should be treated as your work colleagues
- Any group you work with is your software team
- Our classes are called ‘Meetings’
- The processes, terminology, and tools we use for communicating, are the same you will find in most Tech workplaces.

We do this so your communication practices will be industry-ready, and you will have the best chance of success in your new career.

## Our Main Tools

### Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) messaging app. Slack is our main communication hub. It's a real-time messaging tool where you use text and video chat to stay connected to your team (your cohort) and all the support staff at Developers Institute.

Use this to ask programming questions and see what others are sharing. This is the most constantly utelised environment where you will absorb our culture and become a fellow developer. 

- Install the Slack desktop App [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac). Using the desktop app allows you to make video calls to teaching staff and other learners.
- Watch [Getting Started with Slack at Developers Institute](https://www.loom.com/share/a3b3687160364ce8aa9d19e452826736?from_recorder=1)
- Watch [Making calls in Slack](https://www.loom.com/share/67c6ec6d949641e9b84c106493616c76?from_recorder=1)

Good Slack practices include: 

- Contribute meaningfully to the conversations
- Stay up to date with all communication on your cohort channel
- Set yourself as ‘active’ at the start of your day and ‘away’ at the end of it. This indicates to others that you are online
- Indicate that you have read a post with an emoji response


### Email

You Developers Institute email will look like this: yourname@developersinstitute.co.nz

Your email is for formal communication between yourself, Developers Institute, and the outside world. Check your email regularly to stay up to date on any communication we send you. 

We only send vital communication via email. So make sure you follow any instructions, check any links, read the information, reply if needed or complete any surveys as soon as possible. 

Make sure your Developers Institute email is working and that you are receiving the invitations to your cohort meetings.

### Google Calendar 

Your google calendar will play a vital role in organising your day and helping others to know your availability. Your daily meetings, events, and project deadlines will all be communicated to you via your calendar. 

- Check this calendar every weekday. 
- Always check the meeting description so you know what to prepare. Most class meetings will have a listed agenda that outlines the expected learning to have been completed for that meeting. 
- Always click whether you are attending a meeting or not.

Integration of your calendar with Slack is highly recommended: [Google Calendar for Slackk](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar)

### Google Meet

Every day we meet to learn and collaborate in our teams using the Google Meet video calls, the links to these meetings are in our calendars. Any recordings of the meeting will be available directly from the calendar. Don’t worry if being on camera is new to you, video calls will quickly become second nature.

Basic video call etiquette: 

- Have your camera on
- Staying on mute when you are not speaking
- Use the hand raise gesture to ask a question
- Be on time for your meetings
- Keep whatever is in your camera’s view or audio range, tidy and work appropriate.
