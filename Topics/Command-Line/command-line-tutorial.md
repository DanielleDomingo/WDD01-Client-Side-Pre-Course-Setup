# Learn about the command line

You will be using the command line (aka Terminal) every day as a developer, so it's worth spending some time to learn what it is, and how to use it.

Start working on the [Learn the Command Line in Terminal](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/4614926-learn-the-command-line-in-terminal) course on Open Classrooms. You don't have complete the entire course, try and get through as much as you can finishing with chapter 6. You can keep re-visiting this tutorial as you like.

Don't forget to complete and turn in the Command Line Quiz in google classroom once you've finished chapter 6 of the course.
