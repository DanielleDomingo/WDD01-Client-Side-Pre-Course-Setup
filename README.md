### Update Mac

First things first. Let us update our Mac to the latest software release:

- [How to update the software on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541).

### Get to know your Mac

This section is for anyone new to using macOS, or are returning to macOS from a much earlier version. Here is a collection of suggested resources to get the ball rolling with the latest version of MacOS:

- [Mac Basics animated walkthrough](https://help.apple.com/macos/catalina/mac-basics).

- [Mac tips for Windows switchers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204216).

- [Enable right mouse click](enable-right-mouse-click-in-macos.md)

## Software

Install the following software:

### Version Control

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) by opening up the `terminal` (`⌥option` + `spacebar` and then typing "terminal") and typing in the terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

`Note:` If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

### Web-browser

A modern web browser, preferably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), or [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/).

- Set your new browser as the default browser for your computer: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser), or [Brave Browser](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020406572-How-do-I-set-Brave-to-be-my-Default-Browser-)
- `Note:` You will need Chrome or the Brave browser to use the Whereby conferencing tool.

### Communication

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) messaging app.

### Programming tools

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript library. Make sure to install the LTS version.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the open-source code editor.
- Customize VS-Code
  - Install: [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  - Install: [Code Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
  - Install: [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - Disable VS-Code from auto-accepting code suggestions (as it's suggestions are often wrong):

### Setting up Pluralsight

You will receive an `email invite` in your `student email account`. This will allow you to join Pluralsight with full access to all the Pluralsight videos. These videos will help you build a strong developers foundation.

## Day 2 - Git and GitHub setup

---

### Setup GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hugely popular cloud-hosted version of Git used by millions of software teams. The majority of courseware and challenges are hosted in GitHub code repositories so you will need a GitHub account to access the course materials.

To be able to access the material you will need to setup a GitHub account:

- [Register a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). You can use your developers institute account to start with, and add your personal email at https://github.com/settings/emails if you want to add your own email address:

### Learn the basics of Git

Git is one of the core tools that developers use daily. Watch the [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/videos) introductory video series on the Git version control system.

### Self-learning Challenge

Work through the [Quick Start tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) to get familiar with common GitHub tasks.

At this stage you should have the basic understanding of how to `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.

### Stretch Content

Get to know git and GitHub better:

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [GitHub Training & Guides YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides/featured)

`Note:` getting to grips with git is a marathon and not a sprint. So take it easy.

## Day 3

## Day 4

## Day 5 - How the Internet Works

---

As a web developer, you should have at least a basic understanding of the internet, networks and servers. So, have a read through [Mozilla's article on how the internet works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)

### Stretch Content

For those of you that have raced through the other tasks, you can watch these optional videos. You will need to have your Pluralsight account setup to watch some of these.
