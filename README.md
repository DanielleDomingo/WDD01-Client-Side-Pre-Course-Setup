# WDD01 Client-Side - Pre-Course Setup

A set of videos and tutorials that students should watch ***before*** they start on WDD01.

## Getting Started with macOS

This section is for anyone who is new to using macOS, or are returning to macOS from a much earlier version; a collection of resources to get started with the latest version of macOS.

## Git

Git is one of the core tools that developers use daily. Watch this introductory video series on the Git version control system.

## Github Account

Github is a hugely popular cloud-hosted version of Git used by millions of software teams. The majority of courseware and challenges are hosted in Github code repositories so you will need a Github account to access the course materials. 

Set up a Github account to access the courseware and challenges.

Then work through the [Quick Start tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) to get familiar with common Github tasks.

After completing the tutorials, go through the [Github overview and installation instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) and get [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) setup.

- Make sure to install the **Command Line Tools** as well during the install process. 

For the first week or so, students will be using Github desktop to manage their Git repositories.

## Other Accounts

Students will need to set up an account at the following sites too:
