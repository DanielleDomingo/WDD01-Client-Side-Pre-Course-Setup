## Day 2 - Git and Github setup

### Watch Git intro video

Git is one of the core tools that developers use daily. Watch this introductory video series on the Git version control system. 

* https://git-scm.com/videos

### Setup Github Account

Github is a hugely popular cloud-hosted version of Git used by millions of software teams. The majority of courseware and challenges are hosted in Github code repositories so you will need a Github account to access the course materials. 

Set up a Github account to access the courseware and challenges.

* https://github.com/join

Then work through the [Quick Start tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) to get familiar with common Github tasks.

Watch through the [Github walkthough video](https://vimeo.com/433825571/bc1830fb90), and see if you can follow along in your own GitHub account. Try to create and clone a repository, add and commit a file, and push it back to Github. 

## Day 3

### Other Accounts

Students will need to ensure they have a Pluralsight account. There are some links at the bottom of this page for Pluralsight content to watch if you are ahead.

- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

Install the Slack desktop app. Using the desktop app allows you to make video calls to instructors and other students, which can be handy when you want a 1:1.

- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) messaging app.
- [Make calls in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack)

### 1:1 with another student

Today you will be randomly assigned another student to catch up with. During the day, give them a call on Slack. Find out some more about each other, and run through what you have done so far for the pre-course setup. Help each other get up to speed by sharing what you have done so far, and tips and tricks you have picked up.

### Git practice, and getting to know each other

## Day 5 - How the Internet Works

As a web developer, you should have at least a basic understanding of the internet, networks and servers. So, have a read through [Mozilla's article on how the internet works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)

### Stretch Content

For those of you that have raced through the other tasks, you can watch these optional videos. You will need to have your Pluralsight account setup to watch some of these.
