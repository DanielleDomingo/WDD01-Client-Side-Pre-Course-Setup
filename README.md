# WDD01 Client-Side - Orientation Week Pre-Course Setup

A set of videos and tutorials that students should watch ***before*** they start on WDD01.

## Day 1 - Getting Started with macOS

This section is for anyone new to using macOS, or are returning to macOS from a much earlier version; a collection of resources to get started with the latest version of macOS.

[Mac Basics animated walkthrough](https://help.apple.com/macos/catalina/mac-basics).

[Mac tips for Windows switchers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204216).

## Day 2 - Git and Github setup

### Watch Git intro video

Git is one of the core tools that developers use daily. Watch this introductory video series on the Git version control system. 

* https://git-scm.com/videos

### Setup Github Account

Github is a hugely popular cloud-hosted version of Git used by millions of software teams. The majority of courseware and challenges are hosted in Github code repositories so you will need a Github account to access the course materials. 

Set up a Github account to access the courseware and challenges.

Then work through the [Quick Start tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) to get familiar with common Github tasks.

After completing the tutorials, go through the [Github desktop overview and installation instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) and get [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) setup.

- Make sure to install the **Command Line Tools** as well during the install process. 

For the first week or so, students will be using Github desktop to manage their Git repositories.

## Day 3 - Other Accounts

Students will need to set up an account at the following sites too:

- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

## Day 4 - Software

Install the following software:

- [Install Git command-line tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

- A modern web browser, preferrably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), or [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/).

- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) messaging app.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Javascript library. Make sure to install the LTS version.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the open-source code editor.
- Customize VS-Code
    - Install Live Server extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
    - Install Code Runner extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner
    - Disable VS-Code from auto-accepting code suggestions (as it's suggestions are often wrong):

## Day 5 - How the Internet Works

As a web developer, you should have at least a basic understanding of the internet, networks and servers. So, have a read through [Mozilla's article on how the internet works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
